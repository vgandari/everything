  The basic idea of penalty function methods is to replace a hard
  problem, in this case, a nonlinear equality constrained problem, with
  a sequence of easier problems, in this case a sequence of
  unconstrained problems.
  The sequence of unconstrained problems each have the original
  objective, modified by penalizing constraint violations.
