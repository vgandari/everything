label: Shooting Method
pre: |
  The shooting method is a method of solving TPBVPs.

  The shooting method is not a method in the sense that Runge-Kutta or
  linear multistep methods are methods.
  The Runge-Kutta and linear multistep methods are methods of
  integrating an ODE over time when an analytic solution to the integral
  is unavailable.
  The Runge-Kutta and linear multistep methods solve an IVP.
  In the case of TPBVPs, the shooting method is an iterative process of
  solving IVPs until the final condition is met.
