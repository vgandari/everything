**Open-Loop Control** - control technique that does not measure and act upon the output of the system. Most piezoelectric systems and inexpensive micrometer-replacement actuators are open-loop devices. Open-loop positioners are useful when remote control is desired for improved accessibility or to avoid disturbing critical components by touching them. Stepper and ministepper motors often use open-loop as well. The count of pulses is a good indicator of position but can be unpredictable unless loads, accelerations, and velocities are well known. Skipped or extra steps are frequent problems if the system is not properly designed. Open-loop motion control has become very popular. Advances in ministepping technology and incorporation of viscous motor-damping mechanisms have greatly improved the positioning dependability and reduced vibration levels of today’s highest quality stepper devices. Open-loop is by no means a synonym for crude. Even inexpensive open-loop devices can achieve very fine incremental motions. Nanometer-scale incremental motions are achievable by open-loop piezo-type devices. Open-loop systems infer the approximate position of a motion device without using an encoder. In the case of a piezo device, the applied voltage is an indicator of position. However, the relationship is imprecise due to hysteresis and non-linearities inherent in commonplace piezo materials.

**Quotient map** - If X and Y are spaces, and if f is a surjection from X to Y, then f is a quotient map (or identification map) if, for every subset U of Y, U is open in Y if and only if f -1(U) is open in X. In other words, Y has the f-strong topology. Equivalently, f is a quotient map if and only if it is the transfinite composition of maps X\rightarrow X/Z, where Z\subset X is a subset. Note that this doesn't imply that f is an open function.
**Quotient space (topology)** - the set of equivalence classes of elements of X: $${\displaystyle Y={\Big \{}[x]:x\in X{\Big \}}={\Big \{}\{v\in X:v\sim x\}:x\in X{\Big \}},}$$ equipped with the topology where the open sets are defined to be those sets of equivalence classes whose unions are open sets in X: $${\displaystyle \tau _{Y}={\Bigl \{}{\textstyle U\subseteq Y:\bigcup U={\bigl (}\bigcup _{[a]\in U}[a]{\bigr )}\in \tau _{X}}{\Bigr \}}.}$$
**Quotient space** - If X is a space, Y is a set, and f : X → Y is any surjective function, then the quotient topology on Y induced by f is the finest topology for which f is continuous. The space X is a quotient space or identification space. By definition, f is a quotient map. The most common example of this is to consider an equivalence relation on X, with Y the set of equivalence classes and f the natural projection map. This construction is dual to the construction of the subspace topology.

**Rim-compact** - A space is rim-compact if it has a base of open sets whose boundaries are compact.
**ringing** - When the operating speed approaches a natural frequency of the mechanical system, structural vibrations, or ringing, can be induced. Ringing can also occur in a system following a sudden change in velocity or position. This oscillation will lessen the effective torque and may result in loss of synchronization between the motor and controller. Settling times and vibrations can best be dealt with by damping motor oscillations through mechanical means such as friction or a viscous damper. When operating a stepper system, some additional methods that can change resonance vibration frequencies are: Half stepping or microstepping the motor, Changing the system inertia, Accelerating through the resonance speed ranges, Modifying drivetrain torsional stiffness. In order to achieve smooth high-speed motion without over-taxing the motor, the controller must direct the motor driver to change velocity judiciously to achieve optimum results. This is accomplished using shaped velocity profiles to limit the accelerations and decelerations required.

Advanced controllers allow user modification of the acceleration/deceleration with more advanced controllers allowing individual settings for acceleration and deceleration. A trapezoidal velocity profile is adequate for most applications. Its only disadvantage is that it may cause some system disturbances at the “corners” that translate in small vibrations, which extend the settling time. For demanding applications sensitive to this phenomenon, the velocity profile can be modified to have an S shape during the acceleration and deceleration periods. This minimizes the vibrations caused in a mechanical system by a moving mass.

conjugate gradient method - an algorithm for the numerical solution of particular systems of linear equations, namely those whose matrix is symmetric and positive-definite. The conjugate gradient method is often implemented as an iterative algorithm, applicable to sparse systems that are too large to be handled by a direct implementation or other direct methods such as the Cholesky decomposition. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_gradient_method#The_conjugate_gradient_method_as_an_iterative_method

Control loop feedback algorithm (PID) - The most basic algorithm for programming actual robots and IoT devices which controls a specific state by receiving feedback from sensors and applying commands to motors to adjust the state. Examples are: thermostats, autonomous cars, computer guided missiles, etc. This is very easy to implement, but it will require a Raspberry Pi and some sensors to try out. The easiest thing to implement would be a robot that follows a straight line or keeps a specific distance from a wall.

feed forward techniques - The corrections are generally implemented by multiplying the desired velocity with the velocity feed-forward gain factor Vf. The same technique can be used to apply an acceleration feed-forward correction signal. This correction is being used to reduce the average following error during the acceleration and deceleration periods. Combining feed forward techniques with PID allows the PID loop to correct only for the residual error left by the feed forward loop, thereby improving overall system response.

La Salle's theorem (invariance principle) - a criterion for the asymptotic stability of an autonomous (time invariant), possibly nonlinear, dynamical system; if there exists $V(x)$ s.t. $\dot{V}(x)\le 0$ (negative semidefinite), then then the set of accumulation points of any trajectory is contained in $E={x|\dot{V}(x)=0}$; if $V$ is pd, and $E$ contains no trajectory except the trivial trajectory $x(t)\equiv 0$, then the origin is asymptotically stable; if $V$ is pd and $\dot{V}(x)\le 0$ only in some neighborhood $D$ of the origin, and $D$ contains no trajectory except the trivial trajectory $x(t)\equiv 0$, then the origin is locally asymptotically stable; if $V$ is radially unbounded, the the origin is globally asymptotically stable [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaSalle's_invariance_principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaSalle's_invariance_principle)

Linear Interpolation - Linear interpolation is required for multi-axis motion from one point to another in a straight line. The controller determines the speeds on each axis so that the movements are coordinated. True linear interpolation requires the ability to modify acceleration. Some controllers approximate linear interpolation using pre-calculated acceleration profiles (see Figure 8).“Pseudo” linear interpolation is obtained with controllers using precalculated acceleration ramps.

Maze creation algorithms - this would give a great context to where to actually use the DFS, BFS, Dijkstra and A* algorithms. And it’s fun. The maze creation algorithm itself is not useful, but it’s a great playground for graph solving algorithms, which are extremely useful in the real world. A* is also nice because all strategy games we play today use it to plan out the shortest walking route, so you can try it out on a maze.

Motion with Interpolation - When the controlled load must follow a particular path to get from its starting point to its stopping point, the coordination of axis movements is said to be interpolated. There are two types of interpolation: linear and circular.
Motion without Interpolation - There are three types of non-interpolated motion - single-axis, simultaneous, and synchronized motion. Simultaneous and synchronized motion are both multi-axis (see Figure 6). The difference between them is that simultaneous motion is unsynchronized (see Figure 7).
Multi-stage MPC - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_predictive_control#cite_ref-4; This uses a scenario-tree formulation by approximating the uncertainty space with a set of samples and the approach is non-conservative because it takes into account that the measurement information is available at every time stages in the prediction and the decisions at every stage can be different and can act as recourse to counteract the effects of uncertainties. The drawback of the approach however is that the size of the problem grows exponentially with the number of uncertainties and the prediction horizon.

Open-Loop Control - control technique that does not measure and act upon the output of the system. Most piezoelectric systems and inexpensive micrometer-replacement actuators are open-loop devices. Open-loop positioners are useful when remote control is desired for improved accessibility or to avoid disturbing critical components by touching them. Stepper and ministepper motors often use open-loop as well. The count of pulses is a good indicator of position but can be unpredictable unless loads, accelerations, and velocities are well known. Skipped or extra steps are frequent problems if the system is not properly designed. Open-loop motion control has become very popular. Advances in ministepping technology and incorporation of viscous motor-damping mechanisms have greatly improved the positioning dependability and reduced vibration levels of today’s highest quality stepper devices. Open-loop is by no means a synonym for crude. Even inexpensive open-loop devices can achieve very fine incremental motions. Nanometer-scale incremental motions are achievable by open-loop piezo-type devices. Open-loop systems infer the approximate position of a motion device without using an encoder. In the case of a piezo device, the applied voltage is an indicator of position. However, the relationship is imprecise due to hysteresis and non-linearities inherent in commonplace piezo materials.

ringing - When the operating speed approaches a natural frequency of the mechanical system, structural vibrations, or ringing, can be induced. Ringing can also occur in a system following a sudden change in velocity or position. This oscillation will lessen the effective torque and may result in loss of synchronization between the motor and controller. Settling times and vibrations can best be dealt with by damping motor oscillations through mechanical means such as friction or a viscous damper. When operating a stepper system, some additional methods that can change resonance vibration frequencies are: Half stepping or microstepping the motor, Changing the system inertia, Accelerating through the resonance speed ranges, Modifying drivetrain torsional stiffness. In order to achieve smooth high-speed motion without over-taxing the motor, the controller must direct the motor driver to change velocity judiciously to achieve optimum results. This is accomplished using shaped velocity profiles to limit the accelerations and decelerations required.

The Chetaev instability theorem - if there exists, for the system $\dot{\textbf{x}} = X(\textbf{x})$ with an equilibrium point at the origin, a continuously differentiable function $V(x)$ such that the origin is a boundary point of the set $G = \{\mathbf{x} \mid V(\mathbf{x})>0\}$ and there exists a neighborhood $U$ of the origin such that $\dot{V}(\textbf{x})>0$ for all $\mathbf{x} \in G \cap U$, then the origin is an unstable equilibrium point of the system.
The output of a neural network would then be the cost.
There exists two constants such that an $b$-norm will be multiplying one constant by a norm will be less than or equal to

Trapezoidal Profile - The trapezoidal profile changes velocity in a linear fashion until the target velocity is reached. When decelerating, the velocity again changes in a linear manner until it reaches zero velocity. Graphing velocity versus time results in a trapezoidal plot (see Figure 3). Advanced controllers allow user modification of the acceleration/deceleration with more advanced controllers allowing individual settings for acceleration and deceleration.
tree (graph theory) - an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path; any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree; a connected graph without cycles and a connected graph with the least number of edges
Tube MPC - uses an independent nominal model of the system, and uses a feedback controller to ensure the actual state converges to the nominal state

Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows - The basic idea behind VRPTW framework is to solve a constrained optimization problem which minimizes a penalty function for traveling path costs, subject to the resource distribution constraints
Vibration
virtual displacement - kinematically admissible displacement; different from actual displacement in that the dynamics do not necessarily permit a virtual displacement
Virtual Work (Principle of) - d'Alembert's Principle extended to apply to virtual displacements; the virtual work done by the impressed force must equal the virtual work done by the inertia

Z-Transform - related to the Laplace transform through a change of variables; used primarily with digital systems
Zenith - The point on the celestial sphere directly above the observer. Opposite the nadir.
Zero - A value for s that causes the numerator of the transfer function to become zero, and therefore causes the transfer function itself to become zero.
ZOH - Zero order hold.
