main: |
  A small motion in the Earth's rotation axis relative to the surface, discovered by American astronomer Seth Carlo Chandler in 1891. Its amplitude is about 0.7 arcseconds (about 15 meters on the surface) with a period of 433 days. It combines with another wobble with a period of one year, so the total polar motion varies with a period of about 7 years. The Chandler wobble is an example of free nutation for a spinning non-spherical object.

label: simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)
main: |
  computational problem of constructing or updating a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of an agent's location within it; Given a series of sensor observations $o_{t}$ over discrete time steps $t$, the SLAM problem is to compute an estimate of the agent's location $x_{t}$ and a map of the environment $m_{t}$. All quantities are usually probabilistic, so the objective is to compute $$P(m_{t},x_{t}|o_{1:t})$$ Applying Bayes' rule gives a framework for sequentially updating the location posteriors, given a map and a transition function $P(x_{t}|x_{t-1})$, $$P(x_{t}|o_{1:t},m_{t})=\sum _{m_{t-1}}P(o_{t}|x_{t},m_{t})\sum _{x_{t-1}}P(x_{t}|x_{t-1})P(x_{t-1}|m_{t},o_{1:t-1})/Z$$ Similarly the map can be updated sequentially by $$P(m_{t}|x_{t},o_{1:t})=\sum _{x_{t}}\sum _{m_{t}}P(m_{t}|x_{t},m_{t-1},o_{t})P(m_{t-1},x_{t}|o_{1:t-1},m_{t-1})$$ Like many inference problems, the solutions to inferring the two variables together can be found, to a local optimum solution, by alternating updates of the two beliefs in a form of the EM algorithm
