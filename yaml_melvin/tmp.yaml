The size of the matrices increases rapidly with increasing muber of
variables and constraints, and computers have limited memory, so a
framework for large scale system design optimization must make efficient
use of memory.


Model order reduction techniques
Shorter prediction horizon
Shorter control horizon


Explicit MPC

High-dimensional explicit MPC?
