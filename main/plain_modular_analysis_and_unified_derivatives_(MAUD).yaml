  The Modular analysis and Unified Derivatives (MAUD)
  architecture~\cite{hwang2018} is an architecture that improves upon
  the flow-based architectures and frameworks designed for solving PDEs.

  Forward mode computes derivatives of all output (objective and
  constraints) and state variables with respect to a single input
  variable.
  Reverse mode computes derivatives of a single output (objective or
  constraint) with respect to all design variables.
