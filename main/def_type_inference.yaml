  Type inference is where a language infers the type of a variable based
  on its usage without requiring the user to declare that variable's
  type.
post: |
  Depending on the language, type inference is not always possible with
  every variable, and the user will need to declare the type of some
  variables, but a language with type inference usually requires far
  fewer type declarations for a given program than a language wihtout
  type inference.
  A language with type inference need not be statically or dynamically
  typed.
  If a language is statically typed, it can still infer the types before
  runtime (e.g. at compile time) and trigger an error before the program
  is run.
