  Constraints that block the step along $p$ are given a special name.
main: |
  Given the maximum step $\gamma$ from a feasible $x$ along a feasible
  direction $p$, then any constraint such that $r_t(x+\gamma p) = 0$, is
  a blocking constraint.

  The step $\gamma$ is unique, but there may be more than one blocking
  constraint.
