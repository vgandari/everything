q:
  - Proofs are mathematical objects.
  - Proofs are abstract mathematical objects.
  - Characterized by an algebra.
  - Proofs have some notion of equivalence between them.
  - Equal proofs are interchangeable in all contexts.

    By giving proofs an algebraic structure, they can be used as a model
    of computation
