  Demonstrates benefit of direct memory access in MDA codes

  Solving Navier-Stokes equations is not sufficient for efficient design
  optimization.

  ADFlow is a flow solver designed to be suitable for design optimization.

  library that provides direct memory access

  Where do recommendations for developing a flow solver come from?

  Summarize performance advantages.

  shape optimization?
  overset flow solver?

  "ADflow is used to solve both aerodynamic and aerostructural design
  optimization problemsfor the Common Research Model (CRM) geometry
  [4]."

  solver as software library

  sections 2 and 3 are requirements, solver agnostic

  "aerodynamic  optimization  with  a  direct  memory  access  API
  saves 12\%  to  25\%  of  the  optimization  time"

  "aerostructural  optimization,  the  costcan be reduced by up to a
  factor of three compared to a file I/O based approach"
q:
  - How to ADFlow requirements apply to LSDObox?
