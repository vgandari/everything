  Basic and nonbasic set (UCSD MATH 271C 2.14)
  B.24.40

  $j\in\mathcal{W}_k$ implies that the $j^{\text{th}}$ constraint is
  active at $x_k$.

  $\mathcal{W}_k$ contains indices of linearly independent constraint
  gradients.

  In general, many working-set constraints have negative multipliers.
  For standard form, the term “nonbasic set” is always used instead of
  the term “working set”.
q:
  - split working-set from working-set for standard form
