  Graphs and categories may seem similar at first.
  Each object in a category may correspond to a node/vertex in a graph,
  each arrow/morphism in a category may correspond to a directed edge in
  a graph.
  Not every graph is a category.
q:
  - graphs that are not fully connected?
  - multigraphs?
  - which trees are categories?
  - composition of edges?
