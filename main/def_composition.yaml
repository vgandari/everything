  If there exists a morphism from a first object to a second object, and
  another morphism from the second object to a third object, then a
  morphism from the first object to the third object is called a
  emph{composition} of the first and second morphisms.
post: |
  For every two arrows, a third arrow may denote their composition.
  We can construct a composition table, which is like a multiplication
  table, where morphisms are constructed by composition.
  Different composition tables will yield different categories.
req:
  - ./def_morphism.yaml
q:
  - Do there exist/can we invent (logical) systems where morphisms
    cannot necessarily be composed?
