  Programming languages are written to solve a particular type of
  problem, typically a type of problem of interest for a particular
  community.
  Programming languages adopt paradigms.
  There is no single paradigm.
  The reason that any language paradigm or multiple language paradigms
  exist is to allow programmers to use the "right" abstraction to solve
  a problem.
  There may be one best abstraction for all problem types, or there may
  be one best abstraction depending on the problem type.
