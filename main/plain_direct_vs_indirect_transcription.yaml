  Indirect methods involve solving the boundary value problem (BVP)
  formed by the first-order optimality conditions.

  For most problems, this cannot be donean alytically, so the equations
  are discretized in some fashion and solved numerically.

  For this reason, indirect methods are also sometimes referred to as
  ``optimize then discretize."

  Currently the most popular methods for solving the BVP formed by
  the optimality conditions are so-called gradient algorithms.

  An overview of these and some of the other methods discussed here can
  be found in [31].

  Direct methods approximate the original problem by a discrete
  optimization problem, an approach that is sometimes referred to as
  ``discretize then optimize."

  Some direct methods rely on techniques such as shooting or multiple
  shooting, where the equations (1.2b) â€“ (1.2f) are solved for a
  particular control, usually assumed piecewise constant on a grid.

  Then the control is adjusted with the goal of making the cost smaller,
  and the whole process is repeated until a tolerance is met.

  The advantage of these methods is the relatively small size of the
  discretized problem; their major drawback is their stability.
