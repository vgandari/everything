main: |
  A function that is surjective and injective is bijective, but a
  morphism that is an epimorphism and a monomorphism is not an
  isomorphism.

  - ./def_monomorphism.yaml
  - ./def_epimorphism.yaml
  - ./def_isomorphism.yaml
  - ./def_surjective_function.yaml

q:
  - Empty set does not correspond to a type in imperative languages.
  - The closest you get is \texttt{void}.
  - Empty set corresponds to a type in Haskell
  - The empty set is an object in the category of sets.
  - The identity function in the category of sets must accept void as an
    argument and return void
