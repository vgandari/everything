q:
  - number of iterations to converge is unknown
  - solve MPC problem offline
  - reduces computation time of trajectory prediction
  - large memory footprint
  - |
    can use suboptimal solution by limiting number of iterations
    (assuming constaints are satisfied)
  - |
    can also choose maximum number of iterations based on
    \begin{verbatim}
      execution time * maximum number of iterations < controller sample
      time
    \end{verbatim}
