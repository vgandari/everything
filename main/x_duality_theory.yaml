  The form of the LP affects the efficiency of the simplex method.
  If the constraint matrix is fat, the simplex method
  will perform better if the LP is written in standard form.
  If the constraint matrix is tall, the simplex method
  will perform better if the LP is written in all-inequality form.

  Duality theory can transorm the shape from one that results in a less
  efficient computation into one that is more efficient.
