  If two types can store the same types of values, they are said to be
  structurally equivalent.
post: |
  Languages typically require structural equivalence between types in
  order to treat those types as equivalent.
  Languages may also impose nominal equivalence to create a stronger
  type system.
  If a language does not require nominal equivalence, then two types
  that are structurally equivalent may have the same name.
  In this case, the type signatures are aliases for the same type.
